# LiquiSwap

LiquiSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) project inspired by Uniswap, aiming to offer a secure and trustless platform for users to trade various tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. With a focus on decentralization and user empowerment, LiquiSwap enables token swapping, pool creation, and liquidity provision.

## About

LiquiSwap is my personal project, created as part of my journey into learning and getting involved with decentralized finance (DeFi). Inspired by the success of Uniswap, LiquiSwap seeks to explore the potential of decentralized exchanges and contribute to the DeFi ecosystem.

## Features

### Token Swapping

Users can swap different tokens directly on the platform without the need for a traditional order book. LiquiSwap utilizes smart contracts to automatically match buy and sell orders based on predefined rules, ensuring efficient and transparent trading.

### Pool Creation

Users have the flexibility to create their own liquidity pools using custom ERC-20 Tokens. This feature allows users to contribute to the liquidity of the platform and participate in the ecosystem's growth.

### Liquidity Provision

LiquiSwap enables users to provide liquidity to the platform by depositing tokens into liquidity pools. In return, they receive liquidity tokens that represent their share of the pool and can earn fees generated from trades on the platform.
